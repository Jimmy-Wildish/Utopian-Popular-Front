<h2 class="info-doc-subtitle">Introduction</h2>

  <p class="info-doc-paragraph">This is the initial founding vision of the Utopian Popular Front…</p>

  <p class="info-doc-paragraph">
    Aiming for a Techno Cultural Revolution born from the optimisation of the individual and the efficiency with which those individuals share and evolve ideas in order to optimise society.
  </p>

  <p class="info-doc-paragraph">
    The goal is to collectively build, shape and increasingly visualise the future we’re moving into. To do that we have to start by understanding the world we’re already in and the pace at which it’s changing.
  </p>







<h2 class="info-doc-subtitle">Responsibility to Visualise</h2>

  <p class="info-doc-paragraph">
It is becoming increasingly clear that there is a huge global transition underway, a technological revolution led by artificial intelligence that could unfold chaotically or beautifully. The Utopian Popular Front’s objective is for it to be beautiful but for this to happen we have to begin discussing and visualising it because it is moving faster than any government can effectively react to.
  </p>

  <p class="info-doc-paragraph">
This shift has a life of its own. With so many competing global players involved it’s going to be very difficult to reduce pace so we should probably accept that instead we have little choice but to move fast with a new concerted effort to get it right rather than hang onto hopes of slowing it down.
  </p>

  <p class="info-doc-paragraph">
The AI companies are at the helm so it seems important that they take the initiative to communicate relevant information to each other through a possible self organised summit. They could also consider working with the general public to see this vision through rather than simply suggesting government regulation. This could form one of the first objectives of what the Utopian Popular Front refers to as a Cross Inquiry System which is explored later in this document.
  </p>

  <p class="info-doc-paragraph">
Governments and bureaucracy are unlikely to be able to navigate this effectively, there are too many competing global players and the technology is advancing too quickly. Instead we should consider using our collective intellect to get governments to see the bigger picture, rather than waiting for them to define it.
  </p>

  <p class="info-doc-paragraph">
We should see this as a race, an imperative race to apply our intellect and safely get the essential foundations of this vision into place as quickly as possible.
  </p>

  <p class="info-doc-paragraph">
And if we can do this, this doesn’t just have to be a Technological Revolution that may or may not unfold chaotically, it could become a beautiful Techno Cultural Revolution.
  </p>

  <p class="info-doc-paragraph">
But only if we can visualise it.
  </p>

  <p class="info-doc-paragraph">
And only if we express it.
  </p>










  <h2 class="info-doc-subtitle">Participation</h2>

  <p class="info-doc-paragraph">
    The Utopian Popular Front is about spreading information and evolving it collectively through dialogue so if these ideas resonate with you share it with others, discuss it with others and bring your ideas back to the community.
  </p>

  <p class="info-doc-paragraph">
    You can speak to us directly and others in the community via the comments section of the latest YouTube videos. The Utopian Popular Front genuinely believes in the idea of Cross Inquiry and is looking to take your feedback and ideas on board to evolve the information it puts out. The comments do not need to be relevant to the specific video just the cause in general.
