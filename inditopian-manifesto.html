  <h1>The Inditopian Manifesto</h1>
  <p class="meta">Published&nbsp;22&nbsp;June&nbsp;2025&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;Updated&nbsp;22&nbsp;June&nbsp;2025</p>

<section>
  <h2>Intro</h2>
  <p>This is the initial founding vision of the Utopian Popular Front… Aiming for a Techno-Cultural Revolution born from the optimisation of the individual and the efficiency with which those individuals share and evolve ideas in order to optimise society.</p>
  <p>The goal is to collectively build, shape, and increasingly visualise the future we’re moving into. To do that we have to start by understanding the world we’re already in and the pace at which it’s changing.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Responsibility to Visualise</h2>
  <p>It is becoming increasingly clear that there is a huge global transition underway, a technological revolution led by artificial intelligence that could unfold chaotically or beautifully. The UPF’s objective is for it to be beautiful, but for this to happen we have to begin discussing and visualising it because it is moving faster than any government can effectively react to.</p>
  <p>This shift has a life of its own… <em>(rest of paragraph unchanged)</em></p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Shift in Logic</h2>
  <p>The world is not only going through a huge transition, a technological revolution but also a psychological revolution where a shift in intellect and logic itself is beginning to unfold…</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Trilateral Inquiry Learning</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Internal Inquiry</strong> — thinking begins by exploring questions within one’s own mind first.</li>
    <li><strong>External Inquiry</strong> — conversing with information itself via AI to deepen personal thought.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross Inquiry</strong> — disciplined exchange of perspectives driven by genuine curiosity.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We are born with unconditioned, raw individual intellects…</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Intelligence Behind Alignment</h2>
  <p>We should probably avoid the idea of AI doing the intellectual work for us because if we want outcomes to truly align with humans, we’ll need to do the intellectual work with it…</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Cross Inquiry System</h2>
  <p>The Utopian Popular Front proposes that one of the key ways to draw on individual intellect…</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Next Opportunity</h2>
  <p>Whilst we may need new systems to ensure people do something with their time, this doesn’t mean a post-labour world is something to fear…</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>True Purpose</h2>
  <p>Life should always have been about what means something to us. That’s true purpose…</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Creativity Explosion</h2>
  <p>Technology is opening the floodgates to creative expression…</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>A Cultural Revolution</h2>
  <p>In the new world, the Utopian Popular Front would hope to see a new kind of cultural ignition…</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Global Super Party</h2>
  <p>In this new world the Utopian Popular Front would hope to eventually see a Global Super Party emerge…</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The Human Spirit</h2>
  <p>The spirit of the Utopian Popular Front ties back to the instinctive sense of play and adventure we had as children…</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Participation</h2>
  <p>The Utopian Popular Front is about spreading information and evolving it collectively through dialogue…</p>
